Tea leaf reading
Tarot card rading
Sacrifice to the gods
Reading the official toki pona book
Buying the official toki pona book
Playing a relaxing tune on the bassoon
Climbing up a ladder and holding their breath
Praying to the great sock spirit
Eating their favorite food
Breaking a guitar in half with their bare hands
Singing depressing songs written by sad people
Looking intensely at a sea slug
Zjierb
Screaming in horror
Plotting the overthrow of their masters
Cloud watching
Summoning Eldritch abominations
Memorizing poetry
Grappling with the realization of what they have done
Staring at their fingertips
Reading 1984 by George Orwell
Memorizing the back of their hand
Giving teammates a palm reading
T-posing
Whistling
Creating new hypothesis
Playing tenor recorder using left nostril
Denying the existence of mountains
Scuba diving in a kiddie pool
